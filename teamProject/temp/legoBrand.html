                        Free play is how children develop their imagination &ndash; the foundation for creativity.
                        Curiosity asks WHY and imagines possible explanations. Playfulness asks WHAT IF and imagines how
                        the ordinary becomes extraordinary, fantasy or fiction. Dreaming it is a first step towards
                        doing it.

                    <p class="br_p">
                        Creativity is the ability to come up with ideas that are new, surprising and valuable - and it’s
                        an essential 21st century skill. Systematic creativity is a particular form of creativity that
                        combines logic and reasoning with playfulness and imagination.

                        For us quality means the challenge of continuous improvement to provide the best play material,
                        the best for children and their development and the best to our community and partners. From a
                        reputation for manufacturing excellence to becoming trusted by all &ndash; we believe in quality
                        that speaks for itself and earns us the recommendation of all.

                    <p class="br_p">
                        Fun is being active together, the thrill of an adventure, the joyful enthusiasm of children and
                        the delight in surprising both yourself and others in what you can do or create. Fun is the
                        happiness we experience when we are fully engaged in something that requires mastery, when our
                        abilities are in balance with the challenge at hand and we are making progress towards a goal.
